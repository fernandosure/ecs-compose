1. Change the version number in ecs_compose/__init__.py
2. we need to generate the dist build package

    python setup.py sdist

3. upload it to pip

Note If you want to avoid entering your username and password when uploading, you can create a $HOME/.pypirc file with your username and password:
[pypi]
username = <username>
password = <password>
Be aware that this stores your password in plaintext.

chmod 600 ~/.pypirc

Install it via pip install twine
Make sure your .pypirc file has the correct credentials for test.pypi.org because that is a separate database from production pypi.
Build your sdist python setup.py sdist.
Use twine upload --repository pypitest dist/* for your test upload.
Use twine upload --repository pypi dist/* for your production upload.
